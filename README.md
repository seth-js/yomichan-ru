<h3>Notes</h3>
If you are already using Yomichan for Japanese, consider using this extension in a separate browser profile. This is a modified version of Yomichan and the unmodified version will have unintended results.
<br><br>
The dictionary gets data from the Kaikki Russian Wiktionary rip, and it contains almost ~74,000 lemmas. That sounds like a lot, but there are still cases where you'll encounter a word that doesn't have a definition.
<br><br>
The Firefox extension unfortunately doesn't survive restarts. This means you'll have to add it through the debugging page each time, although your settings and the dictionary will not be lost.
